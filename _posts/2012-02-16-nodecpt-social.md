We have decided to organize a meet and greet this week to get the wheels rolling on this user group.

We do plan on announcing a more formal meetup soon, but it would be nice to get to know each other a bit beforehand. 

As it turns out, there is a Codebridge happy hour happening this week, which already has a number of local developers in attendance.  It would be good to meet up there, talk to other people interested in the area, and find out where we all stand on things.  There will be beer and good conversation.

We are hoping to get a handle on the size of the community and its general interests. This information will help us plan the format and content of future meetups.
